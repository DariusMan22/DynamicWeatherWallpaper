# DynamicWeatherWallpaper
You will need an API key from openweathermap.org to use this code. You can generate the key for free.

  This is a Pyhton program that extracts data about weather based on the chosen City by the user through the openweathermap.org API and changes the wallpaper of the user dynamically according to the results.
The wallpapers are extracted using a web crawler. The code is made to run continously and will periodically check if your weather parameters changed or your hour interval changed and will update the wallpaper accordingly to the new keyword generated.
